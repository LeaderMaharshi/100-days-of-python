Instructions

Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

    Under 18.5 they are underweight
    Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
    Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
    Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
    Above 35 they are clinically obese.
    

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

bmi = weight(kg)/(height*height)

Example Input

weight = 85
height = 1.75

Example Output

85 รท (1.75 x 1.75) = 27.755102040816325
Your BMI is 28, you are slightly overweight.

#solution

height = float(input("Please enter your height in meters: "))
weight = float(input("Please enter your weight in kg's: "))

bmi = round(weight/(height*height))

if bmi < 18.5:
    print(f"You bmi is {bmi}: You are underweight")
elif bmi < 25:
    print(f"You bmi is {bmi}: You have normal weight")
elif bmi < 30:
